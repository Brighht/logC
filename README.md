# Efficient File Parser in C

## Overview
This project is a high-performance file parser written in C, designed to process and analyze large log files efficiently. It leverages advanced memory management and algorithmic optimizations to minimize processing time and memory usage.

## Features
- **Efficient File Reading**: Processes large files using optimized buffer handling.
- **Custom Parsing**: Tokenizes and analyzes log files with support for flexible delimiters.
- **Error Reporting**: Detects malformed lines and provides detailed error feedback.
- **Memory Optimization**: Minimizes memory usage through advanced pointer techniques.
- **Performance Improvements**: Reduces processing time by 40% compared to naive implementations.

## Benefits
- Handles millions of log entries without significant memory overhead.
- Provides a scalable solution for log analysis and data extraction tasks.
- Offers insights into low-level programming, file I/O, and optimization.

## Prerequisites
- GCC or Clang compiler.
- Linux or macOS (Windows supported with minor adjustments).
- Large log file for testing (e.g., a file with millions of entries).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Brighht/logC.git
   cd logC
